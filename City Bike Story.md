# Tableau Homework - The Story of City Bike

### City Bike Visualization for NYC Board of Tourism

* City Bike Data is from the Time Period of July of 2013 to February of 2014.

* 8 months of Data were combined using **Pandas** (Python), and the data was transformed to be more usable.

* City Bike uses two distinct sets of data, their "Subscriber" and what would be a more general public. The breakdown for our purposes will be subscriber genders of "0", "1", "2" with a group "Unknown". 



## City Bike Users

Men have a much higher summation of time on Bikes than do the women, however, the average between the genders is statistically much smaller suggesting it isn't a lack of passion that prevents women from biking, but perhaps more attributable to something like the types of clothing or accessories that women tend to have. The difference between subscribers and "tourists" is really dependent on location rather than an overlying trend.


## Age Demographics

The largest Age Range is between the ages of 22 years old to 46 years old. The jump after the the year of 1997 is actually the "Tourist" or non-subscribers.

## Tourism Focus

A breakdown in demographics shows that most users are male: "1" with the next largest demographic beign "Unknown". This gives us an idea of where we would like to begin an analysis. I would Like to focus on the "Unknown", Looking at the starting locations for the largest green members would be centered around tourist locations, especially Central Park.

Looking at the time frames for when most Subscribers (0,1,2) use the bikes you can assume the unspecified gender subscribers in Blue are predominately using the Bikes during a typical "Locals" user time frame 6am to 10pm. The "Unknowns" are using the bikes at times that would suggest they are being used around times at which tourists would utilize them. from 5AM to 9AM are the lowest volume times with the 2ndlowest being 10PM to 1AM. Peak times are throughout normal business hours tailing off at rush hour (the opposite of typical local workers) and the Highest Peak Time being during the closing and after hours of most bars (typical tourist behavior).

This portion shows that many bikes have a much higher tourist usage, suggesting ending/starting destinations are similar locations and tht these tourists are putting most of the miles between these specific destinations. This would allow for a good targeting of non-retail type vendors (such and food, beverage, alcohol, and perhaps clothing type items that arre weather appropriate). I would suggest that the tourism board focus on the largest locations on this map and the routes in between them to focues on traffic patterns and targeted marketing campaigns.
